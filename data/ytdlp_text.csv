"the world is bigger than five countries. with these words, president reep taip erdan addressed world leaders gathered in new york for the 69th session of the un general assembly in 2014, criticizing the monopoly of the security council's five permanent members. erdogan was not only questioning the moral legitimacy of the postwar international order, he was also capturing a deeper truth. the shifting current of global geopolitics and the growing dissatisfaction of a widening circle of states. these are the so-called middle tier powers unwilling to accept the passive and marginal role that the old great powers seek to impose on them in the global balance of power. 12 years later, erdogan's words resonate even more strongly. they are no longer just another revisionist slogan, but a concise description of a new geopolitical reality. look at the world map. at first glance, the picture seems simple. an american hedgeimon and a chinese challenger. two titans whose rivalry will define the 21st century. echoing the cold war, rivalry between the united states and the soviet union, media outlets and analysts eagerly speak of a new cold war, a world divided into two hostile blocks, american and chinese, with every nation ultimately forced to choose a side. but that framing, however appealing to headlines, oversimplifies their reality. what if the real contest is not only between these two superpowers? what if beneath the surface of bipolar competition, a quiet revolution is unfolding? one that may prove far more consequential, redefining the rules of global politics altogether. on the world stage, a new cast of contenders is taking up more space. countries collectively known as middle powers. increasingly, it is the middle powers that are setting the pace of geopolitical change, pushing the world toward a system that is neither uniolar nor bipolar, but chaotically multipolar. international relations now resemble a dense, evershifting web of influence, dependencies, and interests. middle powers are not passive spectators to the us china rivalry. on the contrary, they are actively shaping their environments, deafly maneuvering between washington and beijing, weaving their own networks of alliances, building spheres of influence, and seizing control of strategic straits, trade routes, and energy resources. what exactly are these middle powers? how are they leaving their mark on the global balance of power? and why is this a new reality that has just emerged? let's find out.

unprecedented, however, is today's landscape. never before in history has there been such a large group of states that could be counted among the middle powers. and never before have they collectively wielded such geopolitical weight. by our own reckoning, 17 countries belong to this club today. each drawing its strength from a different source. for india, it is economic might and demographic scale. for saudi arabia, petro dollars. for turkey, a strategic location and a booming defense industry. yet, one thing unites them all. as bulgarian political scientist ivan krasv has aptly put it, each of them wants to be at the table and not on the menu. the rise of the middle powers raises a host of questions, but one stands above the rest. will these states as the new architects of the global order build a more stable multipolar world? or will their ambitions and rivalries ignite new unpredictable conflicts, ones that could plunge the international system into a crisis even deeper than the us china rivalry. the concept of the middle power has a surprisingly long history. it was first coined by the 16th century italian diplomat and thinker giovani bautterero. though the term has been part of a political discourse for five centuries, capturing its essence and defining it precisely remains a challenge. for bautterero, a middle power was above all a state with sufficient military strength to function independently without falling into the orbit of one of the great empires. in his day, that meant polities like the republic of venice, which managed to hold its own in a region dominated by spain, the ottoman empire, and austria. the term took a very different meaning after world war ii. it was then applied to countries such as canada and australia. in this newer interpretation, material strength receded into the background while behavioral attributes come to the four. the middle power became synonymous with a quote good citizen of the international community. a state that promoted multilateralism, diplomacy, respect for international law, and active engagement in the institutions meant to stabilize a liberal world order. but defining the modern middle power is no simple task. any attempt to pin it down solely through traditional metrics like gdp, population size, or the scale of a country's armed forces is bound to fall short. such indicators fail to capture the essence of the phenomenon. the united arab emirates influence does not stem from demographics, and turkeykey's weight lies not only in its economy, but in its strategic location and its willingness to use it. a more flexible hybrid analytical framework is therefore needed. one such framework comes from dinopati jalal, former indonesian ambassador to the united states. in his view, a middle power is the product of three key elements. size, either significant territory or strategic location, weight, economic, diplomatic and military potential, and most importantly, ambition. this last behavioral factor is decisive. it means a state's conscious will and practical capacity to shape events in its own region and to limit the influence of outside powers in its immediate neighborhood. in the end, it is not potential but action that determines middle power status. this definition is of course imperfect and somewhat arbitrary but it captures the spirit of the new era middle powers autonomous assertive actors in the face of us china rivalry. this is what sets today middle powers apart from the so-called relay middle powers of the cold war era. relay middle powers acted as regional proxies for the united states such as iran under the pakavi dynasty. by contrast, today's middle powers act on their own terms often to the frustration of the major players. they have become a problem for great powers, not as in the past a convenient tool for advancing their policies. in this analysis, we deliberately simplify the traditional, often multi-layered typologies of states. while some theories propose more granual distinctions, we opt for a clear three tier framework. superpowers, the united states and china, middle powers, a group of 17 states, and the rest. the most important dividing line in contemporary geopolitics runs between superpowers whose actions have systemic global consequences and middle players which operate as key regional players and increasingly assertive actors on the world stage. placing all other states in a single catch all category. the rest is intentional. it underscores the central role of middle powers as the most dynamic and influential group below the very top of the hierarchy. this categorization draws a sharp distinction between the global rule makers, superpowers, the rule shapers, middle powers, and the rule takers, the rest. our roster of middle powers includes 17 states. some of these choices may seem controversial, but each will be justified later in this piece. we begin our case studies with turkey, which in many ways is the quintessential middle power with its strategic location at the crossroads of two continents, a population of roughly 85 million, the world's 16th largest economy, a robust defense industry, and nato's second largest standing army. turkey possesses the ideal foundation for pursuing an ambitious foreign policy. ankara seeks to dominate its immediate neighborhood. leveraging its advantages geography, turkey aims to become a critical energy hub linking producers from the caspian region, russia and the middle east to european markets. but its ambitions extend well beyond economic dominance. politically and militarily, this drive has been evident in armed interventions in syria and libya, smaller scale operations in iraq, and the decisive support turkey provided to azerban in its fight over nagoro carabach. ideology is also a tool in ankara's arsenal. turkey actively invokes the idea of pantoarchism, most visibly in central asia, where it seeks to unite related nations under the banner of the organization of turkey states. formerly a nato member, turkey often pursues its own agenda rather than the alliance's collective interests, balancing between the united states and russia. this is reflected in its energy cooperation with moscow and its purchase of russian s400 air defense systems. even russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine did not fundamentally alter ankara's approach. turkey sees no contradiction in supplying heavy weaponry to keefe, importing russian oil and gas, and positioning itself as a mediator in the conflict. this should come as no surprise. turkeykey's foreign policy is the very embodiment of middle power behavior like a geopolitical swing state exploiting surrounding crisis to advance its own objectives. but turkey is not the only middle power in the middle east. the region is also home to iran, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates. the latter, in particular, represents an interesting case. what might we call the pocket-sized middle power? the united arab emirates has a population of roughly 10 million. yet 90% are immigrants drawn here to work from india, pakistan, and other parts of south and east asia. native amiratis number just over 1 million. the country's demographic base is therefore modest, but its strategic location adjacent to the straight of ormuz while also possessing ports east of the choke point, reducing vulnerability to any blockade combined with oil and gas revenues, provides the means for an extraordinarily ambitious foreign policy. in nearly every arena, the uae punches above its weight. militarily, it has often been dubbed the little sparta. despite its small citizen population, the country fields a welle equipped army of around 65,000 troops. it also boasts a strong and rapidly expanding defense industry in which the government planned to invest roughly $82 billion by 2031. for years, amirati foreign policy has been built on consciously cultivating strategic autonomy. while maintaining close ties with the united states, abu dhabi has simultaneously deepened relations with moscow and beijing. despite the war in ukraine, trade with russia is thriving with the uae serving as a key conduit for circumventing western sanctions. on the china front, the pace is equally dynamic. since 2017, china has been the uae's largest trading partner, and in 2024, the emirates joined the bricks grouping. the country's multi-vector approach is also evident in its infrastructure diplomacy. abu dhabi supports china's belt and throat initiative while simultaneously playing a key role in the usbacked imac corridor. at the same time, it has signed onto yet another competing project, the turkey iraq development road, which we cover in more depth in our episode on the corridor wars. all of these moves are driven by the same calculus, diversification and profit maximization. no analysis of the uae as a middle power would be complete without mention of dp world, the state controlled logistics giant that operates 80 marine and inland terminals in over 40 countries across six continents. for the emirates, dp world plays the role once held by great trading companies in imperial times. a tool for projecting power and securing strategic interests far beyond national borders. through dp world, the uae exerts tangible influence over global supply chains and controls key nodes in world trade. these investments often go hand inhand with military engagement as in sudan where abu dhabi has armed the forces of general dagalo in the ongoing civil war or in somalia where the uae has established military bases. the path to middle power status as these examples show can take many forms. turkey and the united arab emirates represent cases of ascent, but one can also arrive in the middle power club through relegation from the top tier. that in short is the story of russia. since peter the great's victory over sweden at pava in 1709 secured russia's place as a european power, moscow's standing in the global hierarchy has been a matter of existential importance for nearly three centuries. first as the russian empire, then as a soviet union, moscow was not only a member of the world's most exclusive club. but for decades during the cold war, one of its two leaders, a superpower shaping the fate of half the globe. the collapse of the ussr in 1991 came as a profound shock to this deeply ingrained great power identity. although the prevailing consensus has long held that post 1991, russia remained a global power by virtue of inheriting the soviet nuclear arsenal and a permanent seat on the un security council. this claim is difficult to defend in light of the facts. in reality, the soviet collapse relegated moscow to the status of a middle power. the evidence for this downgrade is extensive. first and foremost came internal collapse. between 1991 and 1997, russia's economy contracted by nearly 50%. plunging the country into hyperinflation, poverty, and rampant corruption. moscow could no longer provide for its own citizens, let alone project power abroad. its loss of control over the posts soviet space was also telling. former warso packed allies instead of remaining in russia's orbit turned and mass toward the west seeking membership in nato and the european union. this was a direct challenge to russia's sphere of influence one to which moscow was powerless to respond. the most symbolic marker of this decline was the first chchan war when russia was incapable of asserting control even within its own borders. seen in this light, the notion of posts soviet russia as a global power is untenable. possessing the attributes of global reach such as nuclear weapons did not change the fact that after 1991, russia was essentially a middle power much like britain or france after the loss of their colonial empires. in fact, classifying russia in the 1990s as a middle power is contentious precisely because at that time it failed to meet even all criteria for that tier. it lacked the capacity to shape events in its immediate neighborhood as demonstrated by the disintegration of the posts of its space and the war in cheschna. the situation changed only with vladimir putin's rise to power. he initiated a slow process of restoration, centralizing the state apparatus, wielding oil and gas as geopolitical weapons and modernizing the armed forces. gradually russia also began to reintegrate the posts soviet space under its control. first through the second chchin war in 2000, then the invasion of georgia in 2008, followed by the seizure of crimea and parts of the donbas in 2014. each of these steps was a calculated act of revisionism aimed at reclaiming a lost empire and regaining global superpower status. in this context, the full-scale invasion of ukraine was meant to be the culmination of putin's more than two decadel long project. this is evident from the ultimatum moscow delivered to the united states just weeks before the attack, demanding the withdrawal of nato forces stationed in new member states. admitted after may 1997. in effect, russia sought to roll back nato's expansion and restore a sphere of influence order. had putin's gambit succeeded, moscow would have forced both the united states and china to once again acknowledge it as a peer superpower. but that did not happen. russia remained trapped in middle power status. worse still, the gap separating it from china and the united states continues to widen. this perspective also explains why putin is so determined to continue the war. he understands that the path to restoring the russian empire runs through ukraine. as zignvinski once put it, without ukraine, russia ceases to be an empire. thus, if moscow loses the current war or even fails to win it outright, russia will be locked permanently in the middle power trap, a geopolitical strategy on a scale comparable only to the collapse of the soviet union. now, let's turn to a country that could be a middle power, but for various reasons has yet to reach that level. like russia, poland carries the memory of its great power past. the legacy of the polish lithuanian commonwealth remains an important element of its strategic identity. but unlike russia's history marked by the collapse of the ussr and the loss of imperial status, after a century of partitions, occupation, and subordination to the soviet union, poland entered what can be called its golden age. a period of unprecedented economic growth and rising international prominence. the post 1989 transformation stands as one of the greatest success stories in postwar europe. since embarking on the path of a free market economy and integration into the european union, poland's nominal gdp has grown 14fold, making it the world's 20th largest economy following russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine in 2022. warsaw's geopolitical importance surged. poland became a key state on nato's eastern flank, the primary logistical hub for embattled ukraine and one of the loudest advocates of a hardline stance toward moscow. yet poland has still not fully ascended to the ranks of the middle powers. what it lacks is the key behavioral factor that distinguishes true middle powers from countries merely aspiring to that status. poland does seek to shape policy in its region, but it does so as a loyal executor of the strategies of more powerful allies such as the united states or western european states rather than as an independent decision-making center. its foreign policy remains largely reactive with limited ability to build and sustain its own sovereign agenda. this is compounded by deep domestic polarization and the absence of crossparty consensus on strategic issues. ambitious projects, whether infrastructural or geopolitical, often become hostages to internal disputes, subject to drastic revision or outright abandonment after each change of government. in such an atmosphere, it is difficult to build the posture of a serious international player. poland thus possesses the full set of instruments needed for middle power status. sufficient demographic, economic and military weight, the so-called hardware, but it lacks the software political elites capable of harnessing the country's greatest potential in over three centuries. poland's historic opportunity to make a geopolitical leap into the higher league may soon close. an impending demographic crisis and the exhaustion of its current growth model pose existential threats to its ambitions. if warsaw fails to use the present favorable conditions to lay the durable foundations of its power and strategic autonomy, its golden age may prove to be nothing more than a brief squandered episode. in analyzing the phenomenon of middle powers, another striking divide emerges. the split between the northern camp and the southern camp. and this is not a purely geographic distinction, but rather a socioeconomic one deeply rooted in historical experience, especially the legacy of colonialism. the north includes the traditional middle powers, canada, australia, japan, south korea, germany, the united kingdom, and france. these are typically stable liberal democracies deeply integrated into the western economic and security systems. as beneficiaries of the postwar liberal order, they have a natural inclination toward the pro- status quo stance. their foreign policy often follows the good international citizenship model focused on promoting multilateralism, diplomacy, and acting as a system stabilizers. while historically aligned with the united states, in recent years, many have shown interest in pursuing so-called strategic autonomy. the south looks very different. it comprises rising powers such as turkey, india, brazil, saudi arabia, iran, and indonesia. many have postc colonial pasts. they are dynamic and fast growing but struggle with both external and internal inequalities. their view of the international order is fundamentally different. they see existing structures, especially those with the greatest decision-making power, such as the un security council, as unjust, oppressive, and dominated by the north. unlike the north, they have no interest in defending the old order. indeed, they actively work toward its erosion. southern powers are thus revisionist by nature, focused on competition, transactional relationships in the pursuit of their own particular interests. if the middle powers of the north serve as stabilizers of the old order, those of the south are revisionists actively working toward its downfall. beyond the colonial era, the more recent roots of this divide can be traced to the outcome of the cold war. it was the north led by the united states that emerged victorious. russia, despite being one of the most northerly countries in the world geographically, today belongs geopolitically to the south. yet, it is not russia but china that now leads the southern camp. this has farreaching consequences. the ambitions of the south's powers can quickly become flash points for new wars and conflicts, something already unfolding before our eyes. turkeykey's regional aspirations have driven its interventions in syria, libya, and the caucases. israel, once a us relay middle power in the region, and now a revisionist middle power in its own right, is also seeking to reshape the middle east according to its own design. conflicts are also emerging between the middle powers themselves. a prime example is the relationship between saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. formally cordial yet marked by a fierce competition for regional influence from yemen to the horn of africa to sudan. in conclusion, middle powers are an independent and enduring geopolitical phenomenon. their rise rooted in a deeper historical process that kishor mahubani calls the great convergence. the catching up of the rest of the world with the west in terms of living standards, aspirations and norms. it is this convergence rather than great power rivalry that is the true source of their strength and autonomy. that said, the confrontation between washington and beijing acts as a powerful catalyst, accelerating the rise of the middle powers. by balancing between a hedgeimon and a challenger, they can maximize their gains without having to commit unequivocally to either side. in a uniolar era, a hedgeimon can always punish that disobedient. but when there are two dominant powers, agile middle powers can play them off against each other. the membership of this group is also fluid with favorable conditions and sound decision-making. countries such as poland, italy, spain, argentina, mexico, thailand, the philippines, or kazakhstan could join the middle power ranks. even ukraine, should the war's outcome be favorable, could set itself on a middle power trajectory. conversely, current members could fall out of this category if they pursue misguided policies. many will have noticed the gap on our map where africa stands. the continent certainly has many aspirants. south africa, nigeria, ethiopia, egypt, and algeria are among them. yet under the stricter definition of middle power, we use one that leaves no room even for italy or mexico. no african state currently qualifies. the mere weakness of the neighborhood is not enough to secure a place in this group. that does not mean this will not change in the future. the real question then is no longer whether the age of middle powers has arrived. it is already here. but the great unknown is whether modern middle powers will become the architects of a new stable order or merely the heralds of permanent chaos. where every player acts solely on its own interest and the global stage becomes an arena of endless regional wars. the fact that the majority within the middle power ranks, 10 out of 17, are revisionist southerners suggests that this is only the beginning of the changes. yet, when today's revolutionaries from the south finally secure their own s place at the table, might they not become tomorrow's defenders of the status quo? perhaps the true nature of geopolitics is not the pursuit of balance at all, but the perpetual exchange of roles in the same timeless game for dominance."
