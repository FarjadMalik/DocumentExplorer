pi summer school andrés arauz what is capitalism progressive international politics knowledge pi summer school jodi dean labor class 3 jodi dean labor capitalism s rise karl marx and friedrich engels wrote simplified the class antagonisms if the rise of capitalism swept away the feudal lords vassals guild masters and journeymen it produced two distinct new classes the capitalists or the bourgeoisie and the workers or the proletariat what is the role of labor under capitalism what are the particular features of capitalist production that generate collective labor power and how has labor organized to overcome the divisions of class and the determinations of private property lección 3 jodi dean trabajo el ascenso del capitalismo escribieron karl marx y friedrich engels simplificó los antagonismos de clase si el surgimiento del capitalismo acabó con lxs señorxs feudales lxs vasallxs lxs maestros gremiales y lxs jornalerxs produjo dos nuevas clases distintas lxs capitalistas o burguesía y lxs trabajadorxs o proletariado cuál es el papel del trabajo en el capitalismo cuáles son las características particulares de la producción capitalista que generan fuerza de trabajo colectiva y cómo se ha organizado el trabajo para superar las divisiones de clase y las determinaciones de la propiedad privada progressive international politics knowledge pi summer school class 5 richard wolff finance class 5 finance richard wolff the rise of finance solved a specific problem that accompanied the rise of global systems of commodity exchange an enterprising manufacturer knowing that demand existed for his product but lacking the resources to make it could go to a bank and borrow money to scale up his workshop or factory in effect the entrepreneur borrowed exchange value from the future how has finance come to dominate the global economy how has the function of lending changed over time and how has finance become central to global imperialism lección 5 finanzas richard wolff el surgimiento de las finanzas resolvió un problema específico que acompañó al auge de los sistemas globales de intercambio de mercancías un fabricante emprendedor sabiendo que existía demanda de su producto pero careciendo de los recursos para fabricarlo podía acudir a un banco y pedir prestado dinero para ampliar su taller o fábrica en efecto el empresario tomaba prestado valor de cambio del futuro cómo han llegado las finanzas a dominar la economía mundial cómo ha cambiado la función del préstamo a lo largo del tiempo y cómo se han convertido las finanzas en un elemento central del imperialismo global progressive international politics knowledge pi summer school class 7 thea riofrancos extraction class 7 extraction thea riofrancos resource extraction in the form we know it today large scale export oriented socially and environmentally reckless dates to the colonial origins of global capitalism it is intimately and violently linked therefore with global structures of economic political and ecological domination for that reason extraction is also a site of fierce struggle with organized workers indigenous and environmental movements and global south governments contesting the predatory power of multinational and historically western firms extractive sectors are likewise the object of some of the most sophisticated theories of imperialism and dependency articulated by radical thinkers across the formerly colonized world today the mutations of extractive capital the ascendency of chinese firms in resource sectors the onshoring of domestic mining in the global north the renewed attempts of global south countries to move up the value chain and the rush to open new extractive frontiers for the energy transition has opened up novel conflicts over the control of the planet s most crucial resources extracción thea riofrancos la extracción de recursos en la forma en que la conocemos hoy a gran escala orientada a la exportación social y ambientalmente irresponsable se remonta a los orígenes coloniales del capitalismo global está íntima y violentamente ligada por tanto a las estructuras globales de dominación económica política y ecológica por ese motivo la extracción es también un lugar de intensas luchas en las que lxs trabajadorxs organizadxs los movimientos indígenas y ecologistas y los gobiernos del sur global se enfrentan al poder depredador de las empresas multinacionales e históricamente occidentales los sectores extractivos son asimismo objeto de algunas de las teorías más sofisticadas del imperialismo y la dependencia articuladas por pensadorxs radicales de todo el mundo anteriormente colonizado en la actualidad las mutaciones del capital extractivo el ascenso de las empresas chinas en los sectores de recursos la deslocalización de la minería nacional en el norte global los renovados intentos de los países del sur global por ascender en la cadena de valor y el afán por abrir nuevas fronteras extractivas para la transición energética han abierto nuevos conflictos por el control de los recursos más cruciales del planeta progressive international politics knowledge pi summer school class 4 silvia federici gender throughout the history of capitalism there has been a tension between two readings of the women s question bourgeois feminists sought greater rights for women in abstraction from the question of class more representation in the workplace in bourgeois parliaments or in government women in revolutionary movements on the other hand saw the question of women s liberation as inseparable from the broader question of class struggle nowhere is this clearer today than in the struggle for palestine with liberal feminists weaponizing questions of women s rights to justify israel s brutal occupation of palestine and genocide in gaza how can progressive forces use this moment to reclaim the struggle for women s rights from liberalism s grip clase 4 género silvia federici a lo largo de la historia del capitalismo ha existido una tensión entre dos lecturas de la cuestión de la mujer las feministas burguesas buscaban mayores derechos para las mujeres abstrayéndose de la cuestión de clase más representación en el lugar de trabajo en los parlamentos burgueses o en el gobierno las mujeres de los movimientos revolucionarios en cambio consideraban la cuestión de la liberación de la mujer como inseparable de la cuestión más amplia de la lucha de clases en ningún lugar está esto más claro hoy que en la lucha por palestina con las feministas liberales armando las cuestiones de los derechos de la mujer para justificar la brutal ocupación israelí de palestina y el genocidio en gaza cómo pueden las fuerzas progresistas aprovechar este momento para recuperar la lucha por los derechos de la mujer de las garras del liberalismo progressive international politics society imperialism then and now the people s academy ch ii unit 1 vladimir lenin described imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism a period in which the consolidation of capitalist forces into monopolies necessitates their outward expansion capturing the land resources labor and markets of another people in this contemporary understanding of the term imperialism has been the organizing logic of the global economy for several centuries yet its effects remain underplayed or ignored in academia and significant parts of the western left without a foundational understanding of the mechanisms of imperial accumulation at the global scale it is impossible to formulate a coherent strategy at the national level in unit 1 we look at imperialism what it is how it has been theorized and how it has evolved enroll now to access the reading list act progressive international academy progressive international politics knowledge the accumulation of waste the people s academy ch 2 unit 2 war is often understood through the destructive effects it has on countries affected by it in palestine afghanistan libya syria yemen and elsewhere imperialist war has devastated economies claimed millions of lives and destroyed the natural environment but war has a more fundamental role in the global economy it is central to the process of economic accumulation it lays the groundwork for economic expansion it enables the capture of cheap materials resources and labor devaluing humans and in the process devaluing nature itself in unit 4 we look at ali kadri s seminal work the accumulation of waste which gives us the tools to understand how capitalism and imperialism waste human lives enroll now to access the reading

mistake of recently being put in charge of a data team and their first response was great what tools can i use if you can t answer the following questions within the first month or two you re probably going in the wrong direction what are the main drivers of the business what are the main pain points of the customers what does the business flow look like who is our customer what other questions would you add more than likely if you re a head of data you ve hopefully got the technical chops to excel in the role but if you don t have a strong understanding of the business you ll either end up

automate the infrastructure deployment process in a repeatable consistent manner which has many benefits for more information linkedin meetup website knowledge technology build a data stack that lasts how to ensure your data infrastructure is maintainable as a consultant i have been called in to review and in many cases replace dozens of half finished abandoned and sometimes forgotten data infrastructure projects the data infrastructure in a few cases may just need a little tweaking to operate effectively but other times the project is either so incomplete or so lacking in a central design that the best thing to do is replace the old system trust me i d love it if i could come into a project and simply change a few lines of code and then everything would just work however so many projects are filled with unclear design decisions or resume driven development that were never rooted in good planning of course business stakeholders may have also push to get things done quickly forcing data teams to take on tech debt that will never be fixed don t get me wrong you want to get things done and move projects forward but taking on technical debt is a decision that needs to be made intentionally otherwise like in resume driven development your data infrastructure might disappear this begs the question how do you ensure the data infrastructure you re building doesn t get replaced as soon as you leave in the future in this article i wanted to dive into the problems i often come into that require me to replace the current data infrastructure and how you can avoid it so

developer should know check out twingate for secure remote work for developers today you ll learn about 7 different software design patterns many of which you already use whether you realize it or not because simply put they are solutions to common programming problems that appear over and over again regardless of the language or platform you re using that s what a design pattern is a repeatable solution to a software engineering problem templates that can be applied to multiple situations and back in 1994 these four developers now known as the gang of four wrote this book documenting cataloging and formalizing 23 commonly used design patterns so i d highly recommend reading that book as it s still heavily applicable today but all of these patterns fall into 3 distinct categories creational patterns are all about object creation so instead of creating objects directly these patterns give you more flexibility in how objects come into existence think of it like a pizza shop you don t just throw ingredients together you might have a menu of pre defined pizzas factory pattern or let customers build their own piece by piece builder pattern structural patterns deal with how objects relate to each other think of them as blueprints for building larger structures from individual pieces it s like lego you can take complex sets and create simplified instructions for building them a death star has thousands of pieces but the instruction manual breaks it down into manageable steps behavioral patterns handle communication between objects how they interact and distribute responsibility which includes the greatest pattern of all time the strategy pattern think of it like switching between different navigation apps google maps for driving alltrails for hiking transit for public transport same goal different strategies in code the idea of patterns that can exist within software is really amazing being able to understand patterns and abstract them out and reuse a strategy to write software is one of the best things you can do because no matter what software you write there are patterns that can make things simpler and make other people get up to speed 0 00 3 types of patterns 1 34 singleton pattern 3 35 builder pattern 5 21 factory pattern 7 47 twingate security 8 58 facade pattern 12 56 adapter pattern 16 18 strategy pattern 20 03 observer pattern 22 49

startup developing bleeding edge deep learning algorithms for medical imagery processing short intro who i am my background and a short summary of my story here i will list the steps i personally took to achieve the goal i had how did i do it why i chose a hacky way to enter this career path the first mover advantage why getting a degree doesn t always improve your career prospects possibly a rant

bureaucracies social hierarchies from my experience and elsewhere list of things not to do and common cognitive pitfalls networking for nerds how to do it right time management for chronic procrastinators how to plan a self guided project some notes on psychology of time discounting and need for external reinforcement with autobiographical examples conclusion you don t need a ph d or

security related challenges of this new computing paradigm as of november 2023 this field moves fast context this video is based on the slides of a talk i gave recently at the ai security summit the talk was not recorded but a lot of people came to me after and told me they liked it seeing as i had already put in one long weekend of work to make the slides i decided to just tune them a bit record this round 2 of the talk and upload it here on youtube pardon the random background that s my hotel room during the thanksgiving break slides as pdf 42mb slides as keynote 140mb few things i wish i said i ll add items here as they come up the dreams and hallucinations do not get fixed with finetuning finetuning just directs the dreams into helpful assistant dreams always be careful with what llms tell you especially if they are telling you something from memory alone that said similar to a human if the llm used browsing or retrieval and the answer made its way into the working memory of its context window you can trust the llm a bit more to process that information into the final answer but tldr right now do not trust what llms say or do for example in the tools section i d always recommend double checking the math code the llm did how does the llm use a tool like the browser it emits special words e g browser when the code above that is inferencing the llm detects these words it captures the output that follows sends it off to a tool comes back with the result and continues the generation how does the llm know to emit these special words finetuning datasets teach it how and when to browse by example and or the instructions for tool use can also be automatically placed in the context window in the system message you might also enjoy my 2015 blog post unreasonable

expert what s it going to take should you memorize the pandas api should you read through the source code line by line file by file should you try to write your own pandas from scratch or could it be much simpler than that could there be an idea a small tiny idea sitting there in plain sight an idea so obvious that you may have overlooked it yet an idea that unlocks the complexity of the tool in this talk we ll discuss what pandas really is how it distinguishes itself from numpy and what the index and index alignment are all about and through the lens of index alignment we will see how to unlock the power of pandas how to understand the vagaries of the api and how to create a simple framework for understanding all the many details of the tool and motivate how deliberate fluent use of indexing in pandas is the one thing sitting between you and pandas effective use for every day tasks james powell s bio james serves as lead instructor for don t use this code don t use this code

so how do you run these projects successful and deliver quickly that s what we re going to cover in this live and more this live is for paying subscribers to my newsletter so if you d like to be invited then you can sign up here  let s build the gpt tokenizer the tokenizer is a necessary and pervasive component of large language models llms where it translates between strings and tokens text chunks tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the llm pipeline they have their own training sets training algorithms byte pair encoding and after training implement two fundamental functions encode from strings to tokens and decode back from tokens to strings in this lecture we build from scratch the tokenizer used in the gpt series from openai in the process we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of llms actually trace back to tokenization we ll go through a number of these issues discuss why tokenization is at fault and why someone out there ideally finds a way to

delgado and kristof schröder discuss the importance of data valuation techniques in machine learning and demonstrate how the open source library pydvl can enhance data quality and model performance effortlessly speakers miguel de benito delgado kristof schröder description in a talk about data valuation for machine learning miguel de benito delgado an applied researcher at the appliedai initiative and kristof schröder from the transferlab team at appliedai institute discussed the significance of determining the value of training data points in machine learning models the core idea of data centric machine learning emphasizes the importance of enhancing data quality over model improvement especially in scenarios with limited or costly data they introduced the concept of data valuation as the process of assigning a value to each element in a training set based on its impact on the model s performance by using the open source library pydvl they showcased how to identify mislabeled or out of distribution samples efficiently the talk highlighted the practical implications of data valuation in data engineering model debugging and development processes emphasizing the relevance of focusing on valuable data points while eliminating less useful ones the speakers also discussed the evolution of data valuation methods and recent advances in the field addressing strategies for repairing or pruning corrupt data and optimizing data collection through techniques like active learning pydvl a library designed for robust data valuation implementations was presented as a valuable tool for detecting data pipeline issues and enhancing model performance in machine learning applications about pycon de pydata berlin the pycon de pydata conference unite the python ai

each series is there a way to fit a model for all the series together which is better i have seen many data scientists think about approaching this problem by creating a single model for each product although this is one of the possible solutions it s not likely to be the best here i will demonstrate how to train a single model to forecast multiple time series at the same time this technique usually creates powerful models that help teams win machine learning competitions and can be used in your project and you don t need deep learning models to do that timestamps 0 00 intro 1 28 melt the

wrinkle to this study that i didn t mention which is that groups 2 3 and 4 all had a different kind of display on the game for the first six sessions which gave them slightly different information than the standard game the idea was to support learner s focus on part of the game but it also meant that there s more than one difference between the control and the other groups the enhanced display could explain some of the difference between the control group and the other groups but doesn t explain the differences between groups 2 and 3 and group 4 and the variable priority approach what i

creatures while women are auditory creatures this means that men fall in love with what they see while women fall in love with what they hear when a woman hears a man complimenting her or expressing his love for her she feels a sense of connection and bonding that is not possible with just visual cues in addition men tend to value respect in their relationships while women tend to value affection and love when a woman feels like her partner respects her and values her opinion she feels secure and appreciated when a man feels like his partner loves him and shows him affection he feels loved and validated understanding these differences can help couples to build stronger more fulfilling relationships to build a balanced relationship it is important for both partners to be able to communicate their needs and expectations men should be able to tell their partners how important it is for them to feel respected women should be able to tell their partners how important it is for them to feel loved and appreciated when couples can communicate openly and honestly they are better able to meet the needs of both partners and create a relationship that is fulfilling for everyone involved

the serbian empire and the second bulgarian empire leading to the battles like maritsa in 1371 the ottomans continued expanding both in europe and asia leading to the conflicts with many states including the karamanids culminating at the battle of frenkyazisi in 1387 as the ottomans managed to defeat their enemies in anatolia they now had time to fight against the burgeoning balkan alliance that formed against them with lazar hrebeljanovic of the moravian serbia at its head his confrontation with the sultan murad i would led to the battle of kosovo in 1389 in the aftermath of kosovo

decline of the kingdom of jerusalem saladin salahuddin salah ad din salah ud din i forgot to explain nur ad din mahmud s coin during the talk on the obverse is an image of jesus christ with a halo standing facing the view there is latin text to the right xcm and arabic text on either side of christ s legs saying mahmud malek al umra a mahmud king of princes on the reverse are two standing figures facing the viewer both are clasping the same cross with latin text on right and arabic text between figures al adel nur ad din that the early arab coins frequently had roman emperors and crosses is easily explained they had just conquered their empire and were using the roman mints to create currency but that nur ad din is doing the same thing in sometime between 1146 and 1174 500 years after the arab conquest of syria is not so easy to explain regardless at the least it demonstrates a tolerance for christians and christianity previously titled salah ad din yusuf ibn ayyub part

muhammad bin qasim with close to no accuracy just to indoctrinate the state s agenda muhammad bin qasim s invasion of sindh in 711 ce was a significant event in the early islamic expansion into the indian subcontinent the invasion was partly a response to a request for help from the local ruler raja dahir regarding the treatment of muslim merchants the umayyad caliphate aimed to extend its influence and control over trade routes bin qasim led a well organized army and utilized advanced military tactics including the use of siege warfare he initially captured key cities including debal and nirun through both military prowess and negotiations the invasion has been viewed differently by various historians some see it as a conquest driven by religious motives while others interpret it as a strategic military campaign without a significant focus on spreading islam overall muhammad bin qasim s campaign in sindh is a complex episode that had lasting implications for the region s political cultural and religious landscape we have used the works of various historians to deconstruct the myth of the invasion which is solely based on the book called chechnama muhammadbinqasim

26 samsara knowledge religion the entire history of muslim china support the channel on patreon the history of islam in china dates back to the mid 7th century when muslim merchants from arabia persia and east africa began traveling along the silk road during the tang dynasty the first interactions between chinese rulers and muslims occurred with emperor gaozong commissioning the construction of the huaisheng mosque in guangzhou over time islamic influence grew in china especially in trade cities such as quanzhou guangzhou and chang an while muslim communities continued to spread despite military setbacks like the defeat at the battle of aksu by the 8th century muslims played an increasingly influential role in chinese society with significant religious and cultural contributions throughout the song dynasty muslim influence expanded as many persian and arab muslims were appointed to administrative roles intermarriage between muslims and the local chinese population resulted in the formation of the hui people a group of chinese muslims who became integral to the cultural and political fabric of the country the mongol yuan dynasty further solidified muslim influence by integrating muslims into the government and military this era saw significant growth in the muslim population flourishing as both scholars and administrators however policies designed to curb their power also led to tensions culminating in revolts such as the ispah rebellion and others during the fall of the yuan dynasty the ming dynasty which emerged after the mongol rule continued the integration of muslims into society muslim scholars architects and military leaders played key roles with the most famous being zheng he a muslim navigator who led expeditions across asia and africa despite their significant contributions muslims faced new challenges especially during the qing dynasty where rebellions like the dungan and taiping rebellions highlighted the ongoing struggles for autonomy and religious freedom the qing government s harsh policies toward muslims including massacres and forced cultural assimilation further strained relations between muslims and the state in the 20th century china s political landscape shifted dramatically especially with the rise of the communist party and the establishment of the people s republic of china muslim communities particularly the hui faced discrimination during the cultural revolution but later regained some rights after the revolution s end today the muslim population in china which includes both hui and uyghur

thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands of years but their history it only began to be recorded approximately only 5 000 years ago and using these numbers we can say that only about 1 6 of human history has ever been recorded imagine what may have happened through all these years that we don t know about how many stories may have happened how many tragedies may have occurred but little data what we do have even that is not fully explored yet for instance some 75 years ago two shepherd children accidentally discovered a collection of ancient documents inside a cave and which are today called the dead see scrolls and one of these scrolls which named the book of enoch gives us some unbelievable information about a certain era in human history which we would never know about if this scroll had not been found an era when ancient demons spread the worst kind of corruption among the human beings the era of hazrat nuh a s and in this video i m going to take you back in that time to

was one of history s most complex and fragmented political entities a chaotic mix of states its borders remained a mess for centuries in this video we explore why it stayed decentralized and how feudalism played a key role in its rise and fragmentation a major factor in its political struggles was the power struggle between the papacy and the emperor which led to conflicts like the investiture controversy meanwhile the golden bull of 1356 formalized the empire s fragmented structure by empowering the nobility and limiting the emperor s authority despite efforts at centralization the habsburgs attempts at reform only temporarily strengthened the empire before it crumbled under external pressures finally after centuries of division the fall of the holy roman empire in 1806

tell your story i hope you enjoyed watching the video and hope these 9 life lessons from carl jung will add value to your life carl jung together with sigmund freud and alfred adler is one of the 3 founders of psychoanalysis which is a set of psychological theories and methods aiming to release repressed emotions and experiences in other words to make the unconscious conscious jung was born in switzerland in 1875 and died in 1961 leaving behind great works in the fields of psychiatry anthropology archaeology literature philosophy psychology and religious studies jung had freud as a mentor for a good part of his career but later he departed from him this division was painful for jung and it led him to found his own school of psychology called analytical psychology as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis if classical psychoanalysis focuses on the patient s past as early experiences are very important in personality development analytical psychology primarily focuses on the present on mythology folklore and cultural experiences to try to understand human consciousness one of the most important ideas of analytical psychology which jung founded is the process of individuation which is the process of finding the self something jung considered an important task in human development while he did not formulate a systematic philosophy he is nonetheless considered a sophisticated philosopher his school of thought dubbed jungian philosophy its concepts can apply to many topics covered in the humanities and the social sciences a good part of his work was published after his death and indeed there are still some articles written by him that to this day have yet to be published some of his most important books are psychology of the unconscious man and his symbols the archetypes and the collective unconscious modern man in search of a soul the psychology of the transference memories dreams thoughts and the relations between the ego and the unconscious besides being a great writer and a researcher he was also an artist a craftsman and even a builder his contribution is enormous and there is a great deal we can learn from his works

movie breakdown is here so on top of all the easter eggs references and little things you may have missed we also want to explain how the film s final scenes bring this hyper femme coming of age story full circle showing us not only where the capitalistic approach to feminism fails but also how true beauty comes from our own imperfections go here tiktok like us follow us get our newsletter written by dodson seitz hosted by ryan arey edited by randolf nombrado lee mazzio and brianna mclarty barbie breakdown eastereggs barbie is a lot more than just a chew toy doug and if this movie proves anything she s a lot more than just a human toy she s a pop culture icon and has been an influence to children across the globe for over 60 years the film is filled with deep barbie cuts and equally deep commentary on the transition from girlhood to womanhood clip the final scenes are not only emblematic of the film s lighthearted and comedic approach to complex topics but its also perfectly encapsulate barbie s metaphorical journey into womanhood doug in that case shouldn t we have a woman talking about this well doug as the only employee in this shop i may not be the barbie you need but i am the ken you deserve doug valid point carry on now if you saw any of the film s trailers before seeing it in theaters then barbie is precisely what it says on the box pun intended on paper barbie s ending is pretty cut and dry the final scene of the film has barbie introducing herself as barbra handler seeking an appointment with a gynecologist this is a calls back to one of the first scenes in the real world where barbie and ken specifically distinguish themselves as different from real people because they don t have genitals she has a brand new identity of her own barbra handler which combines the last name of her creator ruth handler and the first name of her daughter the same daughter who was the original inspiration for barbie becoming a woman biologically speaking is more than just a clever joke about the immediate need for women s healthcare and bodily autonomy it represents the culmination of barbie s journey film s core message while it speaks explicitly to the female experience it has a profound message that can resonate with anyone who sees themselves as less than perfect doug even doggos of course doug i mean its greta gerwig doug the climate activist who sailed across the world and took down andrew tate different greta doug gerwing is known for her anti corporate coming of age stories and barbie is certainly no exception however there are also some distinctive sci fi elements and themes that really distinguish it from her other films i mean barbie land is essentially an alternate dimension the settings and characters are incredibly detailed and visually engaging but they also create a very twilight zone esc uncanny valley feel where not everything is as it seems gerwig certainly pays hommage to these elements right out of the gate with the first scene parodying 2001 a space odyssey but with girls instead of monkeys and giant magot robbie replacing the ominous monolith the swimsuit chosen is not only the one from very first barbie but also the same one that was she wore the cover of a very controversial ad of sports illustrated with a caption that read i belong here it s a perfect fit for not only the beginning of the movie but barbie s story as well there is also a reference to the matrix when kate mikennon s barbie offers the choice between knowing the truth birkenstocks or returning to her old life heels just like the ever so classic red pill vs blue pill barbie movie breakdown screencrush heavy spoilers new rockstars barbie movei breakdown barbie easter eggss barbie new rockstars barbie movie barbie review barbie

large amount of time to produce and i m hoping all of you really appreciate it in this episode we will explore the origins of philosophy and outline this series intentions so to serve this end we ll split up different philosophers into eras there s a good deal of overlap here especially the closer we get to present day but there s definitely something to be gained from telling a certain story about the history of philosophy pre socratics we ll begin with the beginning with a group of greeks and mediterraneans that started asking the big questions what s going on who are we why their ideas might seem primitive at first but they are the key to everything which follows the ancients right after them come the big hitters the names you ve probably heard like plato and aristotle these guys are the ones who really created the tradition and set the terms and ideas that would dominate the thousands of years of thinking to follow the prophets we ll then take a step back and a few forward by looking at the religious beliefs and thinkers that will completely change the terms of philosophy during this time there s a little guy named jesus christ who sorta becomes a big deal the medieval such a big deal that his life and the church that followed him would completely determine the medieval thinkers that came next these thinkers would use christianity as a philosophical tool for understanding the universe the reformers and revolutionaries after the dark ages comes a burst of light in the reformers and revolutionaries of the protestant and scientific revolutions we ll see how changes in religion and knowledge permanently change philosophy the moderns with the world forever changed modern men start producing modern thoughts we ll explore their beliefs their thoughts and their great hairdos the empiricists science and modern philosophy expand with a new type of knowledge of the world we ll spend most of our time this episode on the british isles taking a stab at some of the empiricist thinkers we won t forget to make room for tea time the idealists trying to solve some of the riddles from their anglo saxon brethren the continental germans will transcend the thinker of their day these idealists would contribute the biggest breakthroughs in philosophy since perhaps the ancient days the analytic but some of their thoughts and writing are a little loose goosey and not properly structured analytic thinking comes forth trying to solve some of philosophy s riddles with logic and mathematics the continental but not everyone will want philosophy to be about logic and linguistics thinkers mostly from continental europe will start to rethink what it means to be part of the world things get pretty existential contemporary and then finally we ll arrive at where we are today what does modern philosophy look like where s it going that about does it for this episode next time we will take a look at the group of thinkers that came before socrates these thinkers the pre socratics are responsible for many things not least of which is the formula we all learn in first year trigonometry i ll do my best to make the next episode more interesting than

age knowledge religion introduction to fallacies this is a general introduction to fallacious reasoning for undergraduates the following fallacies are discussed ad hominem this fallacy occurs when an argument is rebutted by attacking the character motive or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself ad ignorantiam this fallacy occurs when a proposition is claimed to be true because it has not yet been proven false or vice versa ad misericordiam also known as the appeal to pity this fallacy occurs when someone attempts to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting feelings of pity or guilt rather than providing relevant evidence or reasoning ad populum this fallacy occurs when an argument is based on the popularity of a belief or proposition among the general public rather than on its validity or evidence begging the question also known as circular reasoning this fallacy occurs when the conclusion of an argument is assumed in one of the premises making the argument invalid complex question this fallacy occurs when a question is asked in such a way that it presupposes the truth of a controversial or questionable assumption equivocation this fallacy occurs when a term or phrase is used in multiple senses within an argument leading to a false conclusion slippery slope this fallacy occurs when it is claimed that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact or result without providing sufficient evidence for the causal connection false cause also known as post hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy occurs when it is assumed that because one event followed another the first event must have caused the second event without considering other possible explanations false dilemma this fallacy occurs when only two options are presented as possible outcomes or choices when in reality there are more alternatives available overgeneralization this fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn from a limited or unrepresentative sample and then applied to a larger population or set of circumstances red herring this fallacy occurs when irrelevant or distracting information is introduced to divert attention away from the main issue or argument strawman this fallacy occurs when a distorted or exaggerated version of an opponent s argument is presented and then attacked rather than addressing the actual argument or position that was originally presented genetic fallacy this fallacy occurs when the validity of a claim or argument is judged based on its origin or history rather than its current merits or truthfulness aristotle college philosophy introduction to philosophy metaphysics plato socrates aristotle basics

this lecture is an exploration of the mystical sufi path towards divine unity as eloquently articulated in the poetry of rumi i aim to unfold the three stages sharīʿah tarīqah and haqīqah constituting the spiritual odyssey of the salīk or wayfarer sharīʿah signifies adherence to islamic law providing the essential foundation while tarīqah unfolds as the inner path of purification and spiritual discipline haqīqah marks the culmination where the seeker experiences the ultimate truth achieving union with the divine i am introducing an intriguing dimension by highlighting rumi s use of alchemy as an allegory for the mystical stages of the sufi journey this parallels the use of alchemical symbolism in the rosicrucian text chemical wedding serving as a framework to illuminate fundamental tenets of rosicrucian philosophy the shared symbolism between rumi and rosicrucians unveils universal themes in spiritual exploration encapsulating the enlightening journey toward transformation and divine oneness as a translator of persian poetry and hermetic philosophy i weave together the mysticism of rumi and the spiritual essence of rosicrucians finding resonance in the symbolic tapestry of

which its own idle fancies have fatuously created and its misguided hands so impiously exalted the chief idols in the desecrated temple of mankind are none other than the triple gods of nationalism racialism and communism at whose altars governments and peoples whether democratic or totalitarian at peace or at war of the east or of the west christian or islamic are in various forms and in different degrees now worshiping the theories and policies so unsound so pernicious which deify the state and exalt the nation above mankind which seek to subordinate the sister races of the world to one single race which discriminate between the black and the white and which tolerate the dominance of one privileged class over all others these are the dark the false and crooked doctrines for which

unrestrained exercise of power by those who owe their ascendancy in human affairs to them are the social and economic ills that blight every region of our world in the closing years of the twentieth century the time has come when those who preach the dogmas of materialism whether of the east or the west whether of capitalism or socialism must give account of the moral stewardship they have presumed to exercise where is the new world promised by these ideologies where is the international peace to whose ideals they proclaim their devotion where are the breakthroughs into new realms of cultural achievement produced by the aggrandizement of this race of that nation or of a particular class why is the vast majority of the world s peoples sinking ever deeper into hunger and

confusing and misunderstood aspects of the grid errata at 10 40 the meter is set to resistance not voltage since current is constant it is also an indication of differences in voltage but the script should have been a little clearer current doesn t flow to the ground it flows through the ground and back up if there is electricity moving into the ground from an energized conductor go back to the source of that conductor and see what s happening for the grid it s probably a transformer or electrical generator in either case a simple coil of wire and the electrical current flowing out of the coil has to be equal to the electrical current flowing into it whether that current is coming from one of the other phases a neutral line or an electrode buried in the ground watch this video ad free

today so you can watch is the universe infinite to learn how far stars stretch out into space and what s beyond them references general relativity dark energy history of the universe all physics explained patreon for early access input on new videos personal answers to questions join my patreon chapters 0 00 energy only changes form 1 19 open vs closed vs isolated system 2 39 is the universe an isolated system 3 50 what general relativity says about energy conservation 6 00 evidence for violation of energy conservation 7 40 could lost energy be transforming into dark energy 8 50 if the universe is infinite then all bets are off 9 47 even if not infinite we are almost certainly losing energy 10 28 opposing view on why energy could still be conserved summary the law of energy conservation may be the most fundamental law in physics it says that overall energy is always conserved it can never be created nor destroyed it can only change form but this law is probably violated by our universe as a whole specifically the energy conservation law states that in an isolated system that is a system in which no matter or energy enters or leaves overall energy remains the same energy only changes form but isn t the entire universe a well defined isolated system since the universe if everything shouldn t it be the ultimate isolated system it turns out that the answer not straightforward if we want to include the whole universe we have to include everything from the very small to the very large let s start with the very small the behavior at the micro scale is described by quantum mechanics at the quantum level the concept of energy conservation is explicitly defined this is shown in the schrodinger equation which states that total energy is equal to kinetic energy plus potential energy energy is conserved according to this equation so there is no problem at micro scales but at the largest scales where einstein s theory of general relativity applies this is not the case what his field equations show is that the derivative of the energy momentum tensor is zero so the simplified way to think of this is that the change in energy and momentum remains zero this is called the principle of energy momentum conservation this equation is not saying that energy stays the same only that the combination of energy and momentum remains the same this means that energy can change as long as the combination of energy and momentum doesn t change so it tells us that at large scales energy is really not conserved in the universe several observations confirm this first is the expansion of the universe empty space has energy if the volume of this space is increasing then energy is increasing we know that the energy density of spacetime doesn t change but energy density is energy over volume if the volume increases then energy also increases another consequence of an expanding spacetime is the observed redshift the light from distant galaxies is redshifted as the universe expands the wavelength of light also expands which means it loses energy so light is losing energy within an expanding spacetime from our perspective could it be that the energy that light waves lose turns into dark energy thus conserving energy overall the answer is no i explain why in the video in an expanding universe we don t even know what the size of the universe really is so we can t define what the isolated system would be we only know the observable universe which is about 94 billion light years in diameter but there is a cosmic event horizon which is the end of this observable universe we don t know how big big the universe is beyond this horizon if the universe is infinite then we would have to conclude that the universe likely does not conserve energy evan if the universe is not infinite it is probably still the case that it is much much larger than the 94 billion year diameter that we observe we are losing energy of the galaxies that are moving out of the observable universe energyconservation some experts believe that overall energy is conserved in an expanding universe because they say you have to include the energy of the gravitational field along with the energy of the matter and radiation in other words as distances between objects increase the increasing gravitational potential between them which is a kind of negative energy also increases balancing overall energy physics conservation of energy conservation of energy physics conservation of energy and momentum conservation of energy pendulum is energy conserved energy in the universe does the universe conserve energy is energy conserved in quantum mechanics is energy conserved in the universe how energy is not conserved energy is not conserved

religion the muslim state and mind this conversation between dr tarek younis and suhaiymah manzoor khan will explore how mental health is positioned as the cure all for society s discontents from pandemics to terrorism but psychology and psychiatry are not apolitical and neither are muslims the muslim state and mind is a book that unpacks where the politics of the psy disciplines and the politics of muslims overlap demonstrating how psychological theories and practices serve state interests and perpetuate inequality especially racism and islamophobia viewing the psy disciplines from the margins this book illustrates how these necessarily serve the state in the production of loyal low risk and productive citizens offering a modern discussion of three paradigms underlying the psy disciplines neoliberalism security and the politics of mental health religion society what is sufism embark on an intellectual journey into the realm of sufism explore the intricate history

video this video is private  exploring basic differences between spouses marriage advice for muslims hina khan mukhtar men and women fall in love differently men are visual creatures while women are auditory creatures this means that men fall in love with what they see while women fall in love with what they hear when a woman hears a man complimenting her or expressing his love for her she feels a sense of connection and bonding that is not possible with just visual cues in addition men tend to value respect in their relationships while women tend to value affection and love when a woman feels like her partner respects her and values her opinion she feels secure and appreciated when a man feels like his partner loves him and shows him affection he feels loved and validated understanding these differences can help couples to build stronger more fulfilling relationships to build a balanced relationship it is important for both partners to be able to communicate their needs and expectations men should be able to tell their partners how important it is for them to feel respected women should be able to tell their partners how important it is for them to feel loved and appreciated when couples can communicate openly and honestly they are better able to meet the needs of both partners and create a relationship that is fulfilling for everyone involved islamicvideo

the world we live in i think as time goes on as history plays its course collapse will spread it is very definitive in the peripheries but not as clear in the imperial cores collapse creates

adam the first man reconciling creation with the theory of evolution dr shabir ally a viewer asks i recently saw one of your videos on evolution in which you indicated that one of the ways to bridge the gap between islam and evolution is to accept that evolution may have been a miracle of god in itself and it doesn t have to contradict islam if we look at man through the lens of evolution homo sapiens gradually came into being through the process of evolution there was no distinctive line where the perfect homo sapien suddenly appeared but rather the process was gradual if we are to assume that evolution may be a miracle of god how do we address the issue of adam being the first man dr shabir ally explains that it is not necessary to say that adam was the first human being based on the quranic narrative there are indications that adam and his spouse may not have been alone and it is possible he may have been selected from a pool of human beings to be a prophet to them if you enjoy

look series ustadh nouman ali khan explains the true essence of the word rahmah distinguishing it from the common translation of mercy he explains that while mercy typically implies being spared from punishment rahmah is derived from raham the arabic word for womb just as a mother s nurturing love intensifies as her child grows within her womb providing comfort nourishment and protection being under allah s rahmah means experiencing his ever increasing love and care available to all regardless of one s actions expanding on this ustadh nouman explains the fate of the people on the right and the people on the left as depicted in the quran he highlights how those on the left will receive their book of deeds handed to them from behind their back symbolizing their unawareness and denial of their impending fate in jahannum hell this stark contrast serves as a powerful reminder of the consequences of one s actions and the profound significance of striving to remain within the realm of allah s rahmah by adhering to righteous deeds and sincere devotion start your quran journey at over 50 000 students are waiting for a gift sponsorship to study the quran on bayyinah tv support them at

to make a wooden katana from hardwood flooring woodworking i like to make stuff i was inspired to make a wooden katana using left over hardwood flooring check out alec steele s series check out geeks wood shop katana build tools supplies i have always been intrigued by martial arts and after watching iron fist on netflix i had the idea of making my own practice katana i had a lot of scrap hardwood flooring from our home renovations so i found some really beautiful pieces and got to work most of the sword is made from left over cumaru teak flooring that i recently used in our house it has a really beautiful grain pattern and some elegant figuring plus it s extremely dense and hard i had just finished watching alec steele s series on making a damascus steel katana so i had a rough idea on how the whole thing went together first i drew out the rough shape of the blade based on some online dimensions i cut out this shape on the bandsaw making sure to leave a tang on the bottom that would fit inside the hilt i rough sanded the blade to give the sword some definition and moved on to the tsuba or hand guard i found another smaller piece of teak flooring for the tsuba i used some calipers to measure the tang dimensions and transferred those lines to the blank tsuba i drilled out this space and had to chisel and file the pocket very carefully so that the blade tang would sit snuggly into it after i had a good fit i cut the tsuba into an oval using a paper template after researching how katana hilts are wrapped in cotton or silk strips i decided to recreate that look with an inlayed contrasting wood i had a piece of scrap oak flooring from my boys room which would look awesome against the teak hilt while i worked on other projects i had my friend josh cnc out the hilt design and the resulting diamond pattern looked just like a traditional fabric wrap i hogged out the inside of the hilt to receive the tang and once i got a snug fit it was time to assemble the major components the tsuba fit onto the tang and the tang fit into the hilt i added a kashira or pommel to the end of the hilt and it was all done i finished the katana with some linseed oil and beeswax polish and it looks gorgeous i am so happy to have my own sword and i feel like a true samurai if you liked this woodworking prop check out the playlist above for more subscribe check out my topvideos

the ground which i have now done say you love the brand i have fixed every issue with zones that anyone has suggested to me that was also a real issue and not a misunderstanding i have also added strategically significant language to try to most effectively evoke the deeper meaning of what the map is pointing at words and images can only point the way to understanding it s so frustrating understanding knows itself as such but those without it often think they have it the right know they re right the wrong think they re right and teaching people to see the difference is what i aspire

knowledge technology long short term memory lstm clearly explained basic recurrent neural networks are great because they can handle different amounts of sequential data but even relatively small sequences of data can make them difficult to train this is where long short term memory lstm saves the day long short term memory is a type of recurrent neural network that can handle much larger sequences of data without those pesky exploding vanishing gradient problems that plague basic recurrent neural networks spanish este video ha sido doblado al español con voz artificial con para

is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human like tasks it enhances the speed precision and effectiveness of human efforts ai uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own machine learning and deep learning forms the core of artificial intelligence what is deep learning deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning it is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms while machine learning uses simpler concepts deep learning works with artificial neural networks which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn until recently neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity however advancements in big data analytics have permitted larger sophisticated neural networks allowing computers to observe learn and react to complex situations faster than humans deep learning has aided image classification language translation speech recognition it can be used to solve any pattern recognition problem and without human intervention to learn more about ai and deep learning check our post graduate program in ai ml p about artificial intelligence engineer this artificial intelligence engineer course created in

react tailwind vite get 80 off with hostinger s black friday deal use code forrest for an extra 10 off at long last i have built my own developer portfolio website not just the github profile page from last video or the terminal website from earlier this year but a custom website with an intuitive minimal design that gives a prospective client a quick look at me and my work as a developer because i want them to shower me with money so i ll build something similar for them okay okay this isn t my actual developer portfolio but one i built in order to teach y all how to build it yourselves the tools i used for this project include vite build tool for the boilerplate and structure javascript programming language react javascript library for building user interfaces tailwind css framework hostinger web hosting platform github version control ci cd via hostinger integration this video is not to go into full detail on every aspect of the development of this project but more of an entertaining showcase to give you inspiration and an overall idea of how something like this is built next video will be the tutorial on how you can build this exact website with these tools

software development portfolio developer portfolio developer portfolio website portfolio website how to build a portfolio website knowledge technology command line tools all developers should know the command line interface a program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions it used to be the only way we could interact with computers back in the 60s and in the 1970s and 1980s command line input was commonly used by unix systems and pc systems like ms dos and apple dos today however we have lost our way with guis or graphical user interfaces most users never use command line interfaces cli except for us the chosen ones the software developers and system administrators of the world we use the cli to configure computers install software and access features that are not available in the graphical interface but not only that it increases productivity it s one of those things where you put more time in on the frontend to learn but once you do you will get that time back in droves 10 fold so in this video i want to share with you the most prevalent command line tools used today let s start off with the shell it is the first thing you see when opening a terminal but it s not the same as the terminal the terminal itself is actually a terminal emulator a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell that would be your gnome terminal windows terminal xterm alacritty but the shell in linux we usually use the word shell to refer to the main command line interface on which we execute programs called commands this would be your c shell z shell korn shell bourne shell bash or even windows powershell it s the thing that allows interaction between the user and the kernel so when you type in ls the shell executes the ls command the shell can also execute other programs such as applications scripts and user programs with one of those programs being our next tool the text editor which allows you to edit text using the command line interface like code readmes and git commit messages this would be your vi vim neovim gnu nano emacs gedit and so on some are just basic text editors like nano whereas developers typically use more customizable and extensive text editors like vim not because they like it more but because they can t figure out how to exit some of these command line tools come default on many systems but many of them you ll have to install yourself that s where our next tool comes into play the package manager package managers ease the process of installing software you can think of it as an app store for the command line even before app stores were even a thing this would be your apt dpkg pacman homebrew or you may be more familiar with some application level package managers such as yarn and npm a package manager allows you to install configure audit upgrade or remove software packages and dependencies from your operating system in the context of the former list now my favorite tool name the fuzzy finder aka an interactive unix filter it can be used with any list files command history processes hostnames bookmarks lines of code git commits and so on it s effectively file search for everything using their fuzzy finder algorithm so if you know the type of file or a word in a file name or the file path or commit message or code or whatever you just run the fuzzy finder and start typing to find what you re looking for system wide or specify to only search project wide and the algorithm will filter out everything that doesn t match you can think of it as real time grep it s incredibly convenient and saves a lot of time i know there are many many more command line tools out there which would be the first you d recommend to a friend leave a comment below and enjoy the

instance in the cloud that you can ssh to if you prefer to work in notebooks i think the easiest path today is google colab suggested exercises ex1 the n dimensional tensor mastery challenge combine the head and multiheadattention into one class that processes all the heads in parallel treating the heads as another batch dimension answer is in nanogpt ex2 train the gpt on your own dataset of choice what other data could be fun to blabber on about a fun advanced suggestion if you like train a gpt to do addition of two numbers i e a b c you may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order as the typical addition algorithm that you re hoping it learns would proceed right to left too you may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train bin val bin you may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a b that just specify the problem using y 1 in the targets see crossentropyloss ignore_index does your transformer learn to add once you have this swole doge project build a calculator clone in gpt for all of not an easy problem you may need chain of thought traces ex3 find a dataset that is very large so large that you can t see a gap between train and val loss pretrain the transformer on this data then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining ex4 read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use does it

attention is all you need self attention attention knowledge technology pca indepth geometric and mathematical indepth intuition ml algorithms github materials principal component analysis pca is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions features per observation increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data formally pca is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset this is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where most of the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics microbiome studies and atmospheric science yt cc on pca tutorial pca dimensionality reduction pca practical tutorials principal component analysis covariance matrix pca in machine learning what is pca

methods to gain near real time access to their data for analytics honestly this has been ongoing since i got into the data industry a decade ago and well before that one possible choice is a method called change data capture also known as cdc i have seen companies employ multiple ways to use cdc or cdc like approaches to pull data from databases like postgres or mongodb this can range from using triggers to reading logs of course this focuses on the analytical component as many companies use cdc to replace or supplement traditional etl elt but cdc can also be a great way to understand your database and its structure databases abstract much of what they do to manage and process large volumes of data quickly here are a a few articles on cdc if you need to learn more how to implement cdc with kafka simple cdc with debezium kafka 0 00 intro 1 12 write ahead logs wal 2 30 trigger based cdc 4 30 examples of where i have used change data capture if you enjoyed this video check out some of

cultural technology gopnik keynote we summarize prof alison gopnik s acl2023nlp keynote she was making the point that large language models llms are not to be regarded as intelligent agents but rather as cultural technologies clarification on intelligence as i understood from the talk intelligence is this one scale that measures things but it is useless to describe reality cognitive systems have multiple capacities so many dimensions and scales across which we should measure not just one which we could call intelligence these capacities can even go one against each other meaning that if you optimise on one dimension you lose on the other originality vs imitation so some cognitive capacities of chatgpt can exceed human capabilities for example memory par excellence but in other capacities chatgpt does not even reach a child s capacity for this she gave examples of causal generalization tests watch a recording of a similar talk here thanks to our patrons who support us in tier 2 3 4

when it comes to open source orchestration tools when i surveyed people about a year ago now it was the most popular open source solution and still to this day my video on should you use airflow drives a lot of prospect conversations now i do want to say that there are plenty of organizations using azure data factory and informatica and there are plenty of competitors knocking on airflow s door but for now airflow is like the php of the data world people can talk poorly about it but it continues to be heavily relied upon now as i said airflow is often why i get brought into many projects meaning i have seen many different ways that teams decide to deploy airflow some scaled others didn t thus i wanted to take a moment and discuss some ways i have seen airflow deployed in the past and the challenges people faced as they deployed their code if your team is looking to deploy airflow or needs help setting up airflow then set up a consultation here also if you d like to learn

helping improve this channel knowledge technology this is the calculus they won t teach you infinity is mind numbingly weird how is it even legal to use it in calculus after sitting through two years of ap calculus i still feel like i don t know anything about it what do you mean that historically integrals came before derivatives seriously what s the deal with calculus there is an inspiring story hidden behind the formulas and word problems of single variable calculus a story that should be told in every introductory calculus course but usually isn t regardless of if you ve taken a few calculus courses before or are just beginning your study of calculus this video aims to give a taste of the insights that can be gained from learning about the history and philosophy behind the key ideas of this field of math brought to you by a dog and some rough animations this video was part of some2 a math video making contest created by 3blue1brown in the summer of 2022 chapters 0 00 chapter 1 infinity 1 49 chapter 2 the history of calculus is actually really interesting i promise 2 19 chapter 2 1 ancient greek philosophers hated infinity but still did integration 7 43 chapter 2 2 algebra was actually kind of revolutionary 11 14 chapter 2 3 i now pronounce you derivative and integral you may kiss the bride 19 53 chapter 2 4 yeah that s cool and all but isn t infinity like evil or something 24 14 chapter 3 reflections what if they teach calculus like this link to further reading and sources thank you very much to dr david bressoud for letting me interview him if you have any questions thoughts recommendations or you notice any mistakes please do share corrections list periodically being updated 3 47 i start a description of archimedes circle proof here but i want to note that the one i present is a modified version of it it does contain a few hand wavy mistakes near the end and may still be difficult to follow that s on me my goal with showing this proof wasn t to give a proper explanation of it but to give a taste of what i thought is the spirit of rigorous reasoning if you would like to see something that is closer to archimedes argument there s a link in the further reading you can check out or you could also just google archimedes circle proof 8 45 i made a typo viete lived from 1540 1603 not 1540 1693 14 35 this is embarrassing kepler s 2nd law is true because angular momentum is constant not because velocity is constant whoops a lot of comments have brought up indian contributions to calculus that i left out particularly the kerala school and madhava of sangamagrama where the first instances of derivation came about a few reasons for why i missed this in my research could be because attributing the beginnings of calculus with indian mathematicians seems like a relatively new historical narrative and many sources in english likely have a bit of eurocentric bias regardless this goes to show how the narrative i shared does have its flaws and similarly to the misleading impression of calculus i criticized modern introductory courses of spreading this narrative is not the whole picture if you have any sources you d like me to add to the further reading please let me know i may have suggested that euler discovered the number e but he did not some attribute it to napier and many others before euler used it on that note i probably misleadingly attributed a lot of other ideas i brought up to one or a few people when they are much more nuanced so take the briefly brought up associations in this video with a grain of salt this video is intended to share a broad narrative instead of establish definitive history of calculus hopefully this can just act as an intro to the subject knowledge why ai can t pass this test

necessary and pervasive component of large language models llms where it translates between strings and tokens text chunks tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the llm pipeline they have their own training sets training algorithms byte pair encoding and after training implement two fundamental functions encode from strings to tokens and decode back from tokens to strings in this lecture we build from scratch the tokenizer used in the gpt series from openai in the process we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of llms actually trace back to tokenization we ll

component behind systems like chatgpt claude and bard what they are where they are headed comparisons and analogies to present day operating systems and some of the security related challenges of this new computing paradigm as of november 2023 this field moves fast context this video is based on the slides of a talk i gave recently at the ai security summit the talk was not recorded but a lot of people came to me after and told me they liked it seeing as i had already put in one long weekend of work to make the slides i decided to just tune them a bit record this round 2 of the talk and upload it here on youtube pardon the random background that s my hotel room during the thanksgiving break slides as pdf 42mb slides as keynote 140mb few things i wish i said i ll add items here as they come up the dreams and hallucinations do not get fixed with finetuning finetuning just directs the dreams into helpful assistant dreams always be careful with what llms tell you especially if they are telling you something from memory alone that said similar to a human if the llm used browsing or retrieval and the answer made its way into the working memory of its context window you can trust the llm a bit more to process that information into the final answer but tldr right now do not trust what llms say or do for example in the tools section i d always recommend double checking the math code the llm did how does the llm use a tool like the browser it emits special words e g browser when the code above that is inferencing the llm detects these words it captures the output that follows sends it off to a tool comes back with the result and continues the generation how does the llm know to emit these special words finetuning datasets teach it how and when to browse by example and or the instructions for tool use can also be automatically placed in the context window in the system message you might also enjoy my 2015 blog post unreasonable effectiveness of recurrent neural

someone at the snowflake summit who told me they made the mistake of recently being put in charge of a data team and their first response was great what tools can i use if you can t answer the following questions within the first month or two you re probably going in the wrong direction what are the main drivers of the business what are the main pain points of the customers what does the business flow look like who is our customer what other questions would you add more than likely if you re a head of data you ve hopefully got the technical chops to excel in the role but if you don t have a strong understanding of the business you ll either end up becoming a task taker who struggles to get out of ad hoc requests or you ll build a bunch of fancy infrastructure that delivers nothing

emergent economy culture religion and government action adventure_game role playing_video_game simulation_video_game video_game_culture cnns vs transformers demystifying translation equivariance permutation invariance in this video i clear up some confusion from my previous videos by clarifying the differences between translation invariance translation equivariance and permutation invariance in neural networks i explain how cnns and transformers handle spatial information very differently cnns translation equivariance cnns are designed to be translation equivariant their sliding kernels with local receptive fields ensure that if an object shifts in an image the feature maps shift correspondingly this means a learned feature can be detected regardless of its position thanks to weight sharing and the assumption that nearby pixels are more related transformers permutation invariance in contrast the self attention mechanism in transformers is permutation invariant without positional encodings transformers treat inputs as an unordered set meaning they lack inherent spatial inductive bias adding positional encodings injects some spatial information but not nearly as much as the strong local bias built into cnns i break down these concepts in simple terms correct my earlier misnomers and highlight why these design choices matter when comparing cnns to transformers if you re interested in deep learning architecture computer vision or just want to understand these fundamental differences this video is for you don t forget to like comment and subscribe for more insights on

build an ai ml football analysis system with yolo opencv and python in this video you ll learn how to use machine learning computer vision and deep learning to create a football analysis system this project utilizes yolo a state of the art object detector to detect the players referees and footballs it also utilizes trackers to track those object across frames we also train our own object detector to enhance the output of the state of the art models additionally we will assign players to teams based on the colors of their t shirts using kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering we will also use optical flow to measure camera movement between frames enabling us to accurately measure a player s movement furthermore we will implement perspective transformation to represent the scene s depth and perspective allowing us to measure a player s movement in meters rather than pixels finally we will calculate a player s speed and the distance covered this project covers various concepts and addresses real world problems making it suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers in this video you will learn how to 1 use ultralytics and yolov8 to detect objects in images and videos 2 fine tune and train your own yolo on your own custom dataset 3 use kmeans to cluster pixles and segment players from the background to get the t shirt color accurately 4 use optical flow to measure the camera movement 5 use cv2 s opencv perspective transformation to represent the scene s depth and perspective 6 measure player s speed and distance covered in the image

available now from on vinyl cd and digital the video for between two points was shot on location in london and manchester with david on guitars and featuring romany gilmour on vocals and harp gavin elder who directed the clip said romany performs this song with an extraordinary level of fragility vulnerability and understated control there s a subtle yet deep emotional rapport between david and romany captured with hand held cameras enhancing the tension within the video directed by gavin elder about luck and strange luck and strange was recorded over five months in brighton and london and is gilmour s first album of new material in nine years the record was produced by david and charlie andrew best known for his work with alt j and marika hackman of this new working relationship david says we invited charlie to the house so he came and listened to some demos and said things like well why does there have to be a guitar solo there and do they all fade out can t some of them just end he has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine he s very direct and not in any way overawed and i love that that is just so good for me because the last thing you want is people just deferring to you the majority of the album s lyrics have been composed by polly samson gilmour s co writer and collaborator for the past thirty years samson says of the lyrical themes covered on luck and strange it s written from the point of view of being older mortality is the constant gilmour elaborates we spent a load of time during and after lockdown talking about and thinking about those kind of things polly has also found the experience of working with charlie andrew liberating he wants to know what the songs are about he wants everyone who s playing on them to have the ideas that are in the lyric informing their playing i have particularly loved it for that reason the album features eight new tracks along with a beautiful reworking of the montgolfier brothers between two points and has artwork and photography by the renowned artist anton corbijn musicians contributing to the record include guy pratt tom herbert on bass adam betts steve gadd and steve distanislao on drums rob gentry roger eno on keyboards with string and choral arrangements by will gardner the title track also features the late pink floyd keyboard player richard wright recorded in 2007 at a jam in a barn at david s house the album s cover image photographed and designed by anton corbijn is inspired by a lyric written by charlie gilmour for the album s final song scattered of working with his family on luck and strange david says polly and i have been writing together for over thirty years and the von trapped live streams showed the great blend of romany s voice and harp playing and that led us into a feeling of discarding some of the past that i d felt bound to and that i could throw those rules out and do whatever i felt like doing and that has been such a joy subscribe to david

npr music twitter instagram aug 6 2018 bobby carter there was a shift in mac miller s boisterous demeanor as he started the third of his three song tiny desk set it s the first time he s performed tracks from his new album swimming in front of an audience on 2009 he rubbed his chin with clinched eyes looking like a young man who s beginning to crack the code backed by a piano loop and a string quartet he reflected on his journey s peaks and valleys thus far i ain t asking why no more i know i ll take it if it s mine i don t stay inside the lines it ain t 2009 no more yeah i know what s behind that door with nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old these words ring like an artist twice his age we were introduced to mac miller via 2011 s xxl freshman class which featured a special crop of mcs such as kendrick lamar meek mill and yg all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip hop after his big splash he s been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats his 2011 album blue slide park reached no 1 on the billboard 200 the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995 s dogg food by tha dogg pound these consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame fortune and insurmountable obstacles causing a stumble here and there throughout the years however mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music for this performance mac miller invited frequent collaborator thundercat who graced the tiny desk last year and will join mac on tour this fall thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on what s the use these swimming iterations don t veer far away from the recorded versions but here his
