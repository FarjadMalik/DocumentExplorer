"Here is a summary of the article:

The article discusses the phenomenon of middle powers in international relations. Middle powers are countries that possess sufficient economic and military capabilities to shape their own destinies and influence regional or global affairs, but do not have the same level of power as great powers like the United States and China.

The article identifies several key characteristics of middle powers, including:

1. They possess a certain level of economic and military capabilities.
2. They are capable of shaping policy in their region.
3. They may pursue revisionist policies aimed at changing the existing international order.
4. They may be driven by a desire to restore historical empires or spheres of influence.

The article also identifies two main camps of middle powers: the ""Northern Camp"" and the ""Southern Camp"". The Northern Camp includes countries like Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, which are typically stable liberal democracies deeply integrated into the Western economic and security systems. These countries have a natural inclination towards multilateralism and diplomacy.

The Southern Camp, on the other hand, includes rising powers like Turkey, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Indonesia, which have post-colonial pasts and are dynamic and fast-growing but struggle with external and internal inequalities. These countries see existing structures as unjust and oppressive, and actively work to erode them.

The article also notes that the rise of middle powers is driven by a deeper historical process known as the ""Great Convergence"", which refers to the catching up of the rest of the world with the West in terms of living standards, aspirations, and norms. This convergence has created an environment where countries can balance between being a hedge against one dominant power (the United States) and being a challenger to another (China).

The article concludes by noting that the age of middle powers is already here, but the question remains as to whether they will become architects of a new stable order or merely heralds of permanent chaos."
