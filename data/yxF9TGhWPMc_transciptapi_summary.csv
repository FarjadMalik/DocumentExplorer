"Here is a concise summary of the text:

The author introduces the book ""Someday Is Today"" by Matthew Dix and shares seven actionable tips from the book on how to achieve more of what we want in life.

Tip 1: The Parking Lot Practice - be productive anywhere, anytime, without needing perfect conditions. Use every spare moment to make progress towards your goals.

Tip 2: The Minutes Mindset - think in terms of short periods (7 minutes) rather than hours or days. Make the most of every spare minute.

Tip 3: The Lily Pad Method - don't feel overwhelmed by a big project. Break it down into smaller tasks and ""leap"" between them as needed, making progress without getting stuck.

Tip 4: Horizon Goals - set general directional goals rather than specific ones. This allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing circumstances.

Tip 5: The Piano Precedent - don't make rigid plans that might be derailed by unexpected events. Instead, focus on the overall direction you want your life to take and adjust as needed.

Tip 6: The 100-Year-Old Plan - imagine your 100-year-old self giving advice to your current self. What would they tell you? Follow their guidance for making decisions that align with your long-term goals.

Tip 7: Purposeful Approach - think about why you want to be productive in the first place. Is it to achieve specific goals or to free up time for what truly matters?

The author also mentions his own productivity tools, such as the ""Year at a Glance"" spreadsheet and the importance of rest and relaxation for sustainability."
